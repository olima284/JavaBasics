What is the definition of an API?

                    Application Programming Interface

**Simply put, an API is program designed to transfer data from one application to another We should think about an API as a messenger of data.****

When you use an application on your mobile phone,
the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server.
The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions and sends it back to your phone

                         Web based applications?
***What is a Web based applications?
any program that is accessed over a network connection using HTTP, rather than existing within a device’s memory. Web-based applications often run inside a web browser.

**Primary purpose in Web based applications?

>They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses
 use on a daily basis.

>A web-based application is any application that uses a website as the interface or front-end.

>Users can easily access the application from any computer connected to the Internet using a standard browser.



                            Endpoint
           ** Is the entry point into our API server**

       >API Endpoint is a fancy word for URL server or service
       >URl uniform resource locator<<“web address”>
       >identifies the “location” of a certain “place” on the Internet

                        Start-point
                   **protocol identifier **

       >Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
       >HTTPS can be used for secure transmission
       > FTP can be used for file transfer
       >HTTP (request) tells the receiving API to perform an action related to data.
       >>ACTIONS : Creating, Reading, Updating, or Deleting data.>>
       >>Create -> POST: Makes a new piece of data in a database
         Read -> GET: Retrieves a resource (database data)
         Update -> PATCH/PUT: Updates a resource in a database
         Delete -> DELETE: Removes a resource from a database

>>These protocols are simply represented by the appropriate keyword (e.g., ftp) followed by the :// ending in the URL.<<


                                 Designator
        >.com - designator is a commercial organization
        >.org - is a nonprofit group
        >.edu - is an educational group
        > gives an idea of the type of organization that is providing the Web service



               WebAPI SpringBoot
               **Route/ @RestContorller**
        > a class/file/section of code >
        > Designed to handle incoming request
        > A Router may contain many route hanlders
                @restContorllers > is an annotation we use to make a router "class" in SpringBoot
        > Controllers -
        > @RestContorllers/Route is classs /file/section of code\
        > Route handler are smarter parts within the Route
        >>@postmapping( "/info")
        >>Method:Post
        >>Path:Info
        >>Host:local Host port  number

        @GETMAPING
        @PostMapping


        GABE EXP:
Route Handler - a piece of code (a method in Java/S.B.) that handles a specific API request.
Best practice dictates: A route-handler should be set to only execute when a specific path is request and a specific HTTP method is used to make the request.
RequestMapping - in Spring Boot, the @RequestMapping annotation is used to create a route-handler. This annotation can also be used on classes (controllers) as well.
When using @RequestMapping on a method you should always use a specific version of @RequestMapping such as @GetMapping to create a route-handler for a GET request.
When used on a controller class, you should use @RequestMapping so that the controller is not HTTP method specific.
